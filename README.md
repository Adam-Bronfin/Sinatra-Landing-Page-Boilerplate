Welcome!

I found the hardest part about making our ideas reality is just getting started with the first few percent. So now you have no excuses!

Including is a basic boiler made from Sinatra + DataMapper running Rack and Bundler.

The app serves a landing page to showcase the product, along with a signup section if the user chooses to click through. Included is a simple User class to keep track of emails for early registrants.

Hopefully this provides a good starting point to test ideas, and even build upon this application for additional functionality. 

This application is easily deployable to Heroku so you can get started in a production environment.


Enjoy!
